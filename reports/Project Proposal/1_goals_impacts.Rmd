# Introduction

## Brief Rationales

As per now, university students struggle every semester to create a
timetable. In fact, there are many possible combinations of classes that
would meet the criterion of their studies. But how to visualize all that
satisfy the time constraints (impossible to follow two classes taking
place at the same time), the modules ones (specific to each university
curriculum) and total ECTS constraints (on average 30 ECTS credits must
be completed) easily ?

The current solution most students follow is based on trial and error,
but it result is somehow inefficient: as soon as a first suitable
schedule is found, the student stops searching, even if he/she could
have been happier with possible another timetable not discovered.

## Overall Objectives

The objective is to design an optimization algorithm that would generate
all possible timetables from a choice of possible classes. From our
perspective of Master students in Management at HEC Lausanne, following
the track "Business Analytics", we face every semester the following
challenge, in the sense that we must choose classes that account for 3
constraints: (1) the **time reality**, (2) the **"modules" allocation**
and (3) the **total ECTS credits**.

## Potential Impacts

While we first aim to focus on creating a optimization tool for Business
Analytics students at HEC Lausanne, this algorithm could be easily
scaled up to be used with other orientations for instance of the Master
in Management. If successful, we can imagine that the HEC administration
could offer such solutions to all of its students (Bsc/Msc).
