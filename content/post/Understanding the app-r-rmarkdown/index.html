<div id="semesters-choice" class="section level1">
<h1>Semesters’ choice</h1>
<p>There are three tabs, for the three semesters of classes of the Master.<br />
You can navigate across them by simply clicking on it at the top of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-timetable-suggestion" class="section level1">
<h1>Initial timetable suggestion</h1>
<p>To display an initial timetable, click on “Suggest” on the sidebar panel.</p>
<p>You have the choice to either view, by moving across tabs in the main panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>two visual representations of the selected classes (half-semester classes):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>one for the first seven weeks of the semester</p></li>
<li><p>one for the last seven weeks of the semester</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>a textual summary of the selected classes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the mandatory classes of this master are pre-selected and will be included in the suggested timetable even if de-selected them from the list of preferred classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="users-preferences" class="section level1">
<h1>User’s preferences</h1>
<p>You can of course also input your preferences to have a personalized timetable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how many credits you want to do in the Business Analytics track (core credits) ?</p></li>
<li><p>how many credits you want to do as elective classes (non mandatory ones) ?</p></li>
<li><p>which half-days you want to have class ?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="issues" class="section level1">
<h1>Issues</h1>
<p>Note that if no timetable is displayed, it simply mean your preferences could not be satisfied.<br />
In this case, you need to either choose more days and remove conflicting classes.</p>
<p>A good advice is always to start from the first generated timetable.<br />
Otherwise, to only add a few favorite classes and then scale it up.</p>
</div>
