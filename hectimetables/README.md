# hectimetables

`hectimetables` is an R package containing data set of classes of Business Analytics track of the Master in Management of the University of Lausanne (HEC), for the year 2020-2022. 

It provides a function to create a matrix of constraints used to perform a binary optimization of classes to select or not, depending on how many total credits the student aim to pass in a given semester, how many core and elective credits he/she wants, as well as some half-days moment he/she does not want any class (Monday to Friday, AM or PM). 
It also generate some nice table containing which classes to take, as well as a visual representation of the timetable selected. A shinyApp is also constructed for this aim.
