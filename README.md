Available to the interest user are a set of functions used in the ShinyApp: 
1) `dummy_creation()`: a function to create a matrix of constraints used to perform a binary optimisation of classes to select or not, depending on how many total credits the student aim to pass in a given semester, how many core and elective credits he/she wants, as well as some half-days moment he/she does not want any class (Monday to Friday, AM or PM)
2) `class_optim()`: a function that takes the preferences of the user in the ShinyApp and makes it possible with the matrix of constraints
3) `display_text_timetable()` and `display_visual_timetable()`: two functions to generate some nice table or visual containing which classes to take
